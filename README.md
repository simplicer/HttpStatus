# HTTP Status Codes Library

This library provides a comprehensive list of HTTP status codes, their texts, and descriptions, as well as utility methods for working with HTTP status codes.

## Installation

Use composer to install the library:

```sh
composer require simplicer/http
```

## Usage

### Accessing Status Codes

You can access status codes directly using the provided constants:

```php
use Simplicer\Http\Status\Code;

echo Code::OK; // Outputs: 200
```

### Accessing Status Texts

Use the `getText` method to get the text representation of a status code:

```php
echo Code::getText(Code::OK); // Outputs: "OK"
```

### Accessing Status Descriptions

Use the `getDescription` method to get a description of a status code:

```php
echo Code::getDescription(Code::OK); // Outputs: "The request was successfully processed."
```

### Accessing Status Headers

Use the `getStatusHeader` method to get a formatted status header:

```php
echo Code::getStatusHeader(Code::OK); // Outputs: "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

### Validating Status Codes

Use the `isValidStatusCode` method to check if a status code is valid:

```php
var_dump(Code::isValidStatusCode(200)); // Outputs: bool(true)
var_dump(Code::isValidStatusCode(999)); // Outputs: bool(false)
```

### Grouping Status Codes by Category

You can get status codes grouped by their categories:

```php
$statusCodesByCategory = Code::getStatusCodesByCategory();
print_r($statusCodesByCategory);
```

### Calling Status Codes as Methods

You can call status codes as methods directly:

```php
echo Code::OK(); // Outputs: 200
```

## Handling Invalid Status Code Exceptions

This library throws an `InvalidStatusCodeException` when an invalid HTTP status code is encountered. You can catch and handle this exception in your code as follows:

```php
use Simplicer\Http\Status\Code;
use Simplicer\Http\Status\InvalidStatusCodeException;

try {
    $statusCode = Code::INVALID_STATUS_CODE_CONSTANT();
} catch (InvalidStatusCodeException $e) {
    echo "Caught exception: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    echo "Invalid status code: " . $e->getStatusCode() . "\n";
}
```
